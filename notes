JFrame:
Is a part of a collection of components, its the "frame" of a painting, part of a larger collections of GUI components
JFrame, JPanel, JTextField, JScrollPane, JLabel...

JFrame is not visible by default and it needs to be on bottom or you get black screens
    & if you shut down the Window you need to call it to shut down fully.

EXIT_ON_CLOSE is an integer --> it have 3 like HIDE_ON_CLOSE ect.

JFrame is on a painting the frame itself and the JPanel is the picture itself

paintComponent is from JPanel to show Graphical things (read more about it didn't understand it) and Graphics is to draw
actuality
JPanel -> Brush
Graphics -> Paint you can do with the brush
super.paintComponent(g); call the superclass (JPanel -> JComponent) and then it starts painting itself

Self-Research:
Like I was used to in C# summary's for constructors you did /// and here in Java you use javadoc.
  /**
     * Title
     *
     * @param param1 Description for the first param.
     * @param param2 Description for the second param.
     *
     */

Important that the code needs to be line by line. I did first GameWindow then GamePanel and then it gave me errors.
